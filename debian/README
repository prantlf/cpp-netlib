The Debian Package cpp-netlib
-----------------------------

This package makes the development with the cpp-netlib easier by providing
an automated installation.  If you run multiple development environments
you can just maintain them by the standard apt-get.

There is one cpp-netlib-dev package containing public headers and static
libraries for development purposes and one cpp-netlib, which is currently
empty but may contain runtime or other files in the future.
